unity-profiles
==============

A web application for setting up profiles that define the behavior of your Unity3D games. It aims to provide an easy interface to allow developers to enable designers and managers to do all the tweaking and to be able to share different settings between them.

The version of the server side API is almost complete. After more tests are written to improve code coverage work will begin on the client web application.

The code style I've used for this project is documented [here](http://nodeguide.com/style.html). It is enforced with a jshint grunt task so the Travis build will fail if any of the code doesn't match this style.

The work in progress API documentation can be found at this [Apiary page](http://docs.unityprofiles.apiary.io/)
Note: This is out of date as there were some pretty big API changes. This will be updated to reflect the changes very soon.
